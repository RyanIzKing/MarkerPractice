<!--This is an HTML file for a practice exercise that I did through freecodecamp.org.
My comments throughout the code were put in afterwards so that I could then comprehend even more of the code after
I followed directions from the website? You will also see questions that I created for myself to then answer at the bottom
of the code.-->

<!--This establishes the beggining of what type of code you are using to create the site-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--Here the "html" element is used to store the html code-->
<html lang="en">
    <!--The "head" element is used to store information about your website, its name, style, devices its made for, html code type, etc.-->
  <head>
    <!--"Meta"is used to once again let developers know what the document is going to be about briefly here
    As you can from the exercise you DO NOT need multiple meta tags as they can all fit under one tag!-->
